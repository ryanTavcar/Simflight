Latrobe Valley Aero Club has purchased an innovative solution to their immediate need for a CASA approved flight training device. Simflight will supply the PI-135 hardware with SFTD software pre-loaded on a PC workstation, 22" LCD monitor for the pilot, 19" LCD monitor for the instructor and a pilot seat pre-installed on a floor with pedals. Included is also paperwork for CASA approval. The Aero Club will construct their own enclosure, slip-in the seat assembly in with the PI-135 set-up and they are away.
