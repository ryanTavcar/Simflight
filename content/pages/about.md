    text: >
      To maintain our leading position of providing quality built Category B
      approved Synthetic Trainers.


      The Company first began in 1995 trading as Support Pilot Services. It
      provided quality ground based IFR training using a LINK Airtrainer model
      AT-67. This trainer was first built in the early sixties and used for many
      years by Ansett Australia for airline pilot training. It has two axii of
      motion in pitch and roll and uses vacuum tubes yet is an excellent IFR
      trainer. It is still used by the company today. Support Pilot Services
      still trades today selling Mike (lip) lights to the Australasian market as
      an exclusive agent for Seitz Scientific Industries, USA.
